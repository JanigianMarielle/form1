<h2>Introduction to Energy</h2>
</head>

<p>The data set I chose to research is about energy. This webpage details different fuel sources, and how these sources are produced, consumed, and the different expenditures relating to these sources.</p>
<p>Energy is used in many sectors of our world. Namely in residential, industrial, and commercial settings as well as for transportation.</p>
<h2>Fuel Sources</h2>
<p>there are over ten fuel sources that are used today. Certain fuel sources have become more popular. Such as coal during the industrial revolution. Certain states produce more of these sources than others. I think this would be interesting to look into further.</p>

<p>US energy consumption patterns have changed throughout the history of the US. For example, coal become a popular energy source during the Industrial Revolution. </p>
<p>On my webpage I plan to create a graph to display this data of how energy sources have changed and how they are currently used today.</p>
